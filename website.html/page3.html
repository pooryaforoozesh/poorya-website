        Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States. An estimated 28.3 million U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, and about 2.80 million U.S. middle and high school students use at least one tobacco product, including e-cigarettes.</p>

        Tobacco was introduced elsewhere in continental Europe more easily. Iberia exported "ropes" of dry leaves in baskets to the Netherlands and southern Germany; for a while tobacco was in Spanish called canaster after the word for basket (canastro), and influenced the German Knaster. In Italy, Prospero Santacroce in 1561 and Nicolo Torbabuoni in 1570 introduced it to gardens after seeing the plant on diplomatic missions. </p>

        <p>the Japanese were introduced to tobacco by Portuguese sailors from 1542.

Tobacco first arrived in the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century by the Spanish,[11] where it attracted the attention of doctors[12] and became a commonly prescribed medicine for many ailments. Although tobacco was initially prescribed as medicine, further study led to claims that smoking caused dizziness, fatigue, dulling of the senses, and a foul taste/odour in the mouth.</p>

        <p >Although Nicotiana suaveolens is native to Australia,[7] tobacco smoking first reached that continent shores when it was introduced to northern-dwelling Indigenous communities by visiting Indonesian fishermen in the early 18th century.
